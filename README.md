# React
Are you looking to join a place where communities can comfortably share feedback and interact with one another as they go through a similar experience? Reaxion focuses on serial group meetings, such as classes or team sports, or one-offs, such as performances or trainings, and gives users a platform to give and receive immediate, emotional, anonymous feedback.


Project Description: 
Reaxion provides a platform that allows users to securely create and join communities. Community founders can post events, about which community members can anonymously share feedback in the form of emojis and comments. The feedback window is open for 20 minutes, after which the community's feedback is visible to all of the community members. Feedback is not visible until the feedback window is cl;osed.


Use:

Users are tasked with either registering or signing in to Reaxion. If a user is registering, they must provide an email and password. At this point they can also fill in optional information, such as their first and last name. Registered users can sign in via their

Once registered, users are prompted to either create a community with a name and a unique keyword, or join a community via that community's keyword. Only community founders, henceforth known as facilitators, can create events within communities.

Users are able to edit their profile, such as updating their name, description and user icon.

Once the community founder, or facilitator, creates an event, that event will automatically show on the user's home page for them to react to. Previous events and their anonymized feedback will show on a user's home page, so long as they are outside of the feedback window.

Users can edit reactions or comments during the open event window. However, after that period has ended, users cano no longer edit or delete their feedback.
