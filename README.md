# React
Are you looking to join a place where communities can openly share and interact with one another, as they go through a similar experience, such as classes, performances, training, or team sports; All in a manner that is conducive to growing together and focusing on your privacy, if so React is a place for you.

Project Description: 
React provides a platform that allows users to securely create and join communities, share feedback in the form of quick reactions like emojis, along with more detailed comments.

How to use React:
Users are first tasked with either registering or signing in for React. If a user is registering, they have to provide an email and password, they can also fill in optional information such as their first and last name. For users who are signing back in, they simply need to provide their email affiliated to their account, and their password. 

Once signed in, users are able to create communities or join a community, and are assigned the role of Facilitator. If a user is a Facilitator, they have the ability to create events, edit information about the community along with other administrator like duties. When joining a community, a member could easily share a keyword, which if inputted correctly will give that user access to the community. 

Users are able to edit their profile, such as updating their name, description and their User Icon. When a Facilitator opens up an event, it allows for a time restricted interaction to take place, where anyone in that community, can share a quick reaction in the form of an emoji and comments. The reactions collected are not visible, unitl the window for them has closed. At that moment, the reactions are shown to all the users in the community, however each emoji reaction is anonymized, so no users are able to identify whose reaction belongs to which individual. The comments collected allow users to openly share their opinions, and are identified with the user. 

If a user feels they would like to edit their reaction or their comment while the window is open, they have the ability to do so, users can also delete their comments within that time period as well. However, after that period has ended, no edits or deletes are available. If you as a user, see a comment that aligns with you, you are able to upvote that comment, your upvote will remain anonymous to other users as well. 

Arriving back to the user profile, users are able to view their posts, and comments. The user profile page has additional functionality for Facilitators, as they are able to see their communities that they are a facilitator for, and have additional information related to these communities, such as past Events. 
Users can also interact with the My communities page, in which they can easily see the various communities in which they are a member, and access content such as posts and comments there. 
The user also has the ability to delete their profile, if they so choose. If the user would like to return to React, they can easily log out. Also just in case the user has forgotten to log out, the user will automatically be logged out in 30 minutes.
